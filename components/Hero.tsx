            I travel and hike a lot in the mountains. After studying human resource management, I became a snowboard instructor, 
            started traveling and volunteering around the world. Gradually I bought my first tent and started multi-day hikes. 
            I've written 8 travelogues and founded the travel festival "Cestou necestou". Since I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2019, 
            I've been seeking out mountains and occasionally local festivals and celebrations. I hope my stories, presentations, and travelogues 
            will bring you lots of inspiration for your journeys.
