            Hello! I'm currently a student at National Taiwan University. I have a deep love for traveling and observing the world around me. 
            Every journey brings new places, new perspectives, and, most importantly, wonderful people I'm grateful to meet along the way.
            <br /><br />
            This blog is my way of collecting and preserving the things I care about—travel moments, everyday thoughts, and reflections from my daily life. 
            In the Daily Life section, I write about my university experiences as well as insights from books and articles I've read.
            <br /><br />
            Feel free to leave a comment and share your thoughts. I'd love for this space to be one where we can exchange ideas and experiences together.
