      <p>The Milan Cathedral (Duomo di Milano) is a representative landmark of Milan and one of the world's largest Gothic churches. The white marble construction, intricate spires and statues create a sense of grandeur when viewed from the square. From the roof, you can appreciate the details of the spires up close, and on clear days, you can even see the Alps in the distance, symbolizing the spirit of Milan.</p>

    <div class="prose prose-base max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      <p>The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II connects the Milan Cathedral and La Scala Opera House, serving as Milan's "living room." With its glass dome and ornate floor, the Galleria houses boutiques, cafes, and restaurants, creating an elegant and lively atmosphere that blends fashion and history. It's a popular spot for photos and relaxation, and the Italian pizza we had there was really delicious.</p>
